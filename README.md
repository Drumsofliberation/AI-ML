This repository contains my work from a guided course in Machine Learning & Data Science under the mentorship of my professor.

It covers the core foundations every data scientist needs:
🐍 Python Programming – Syntax, control flow, and functions
🔢 Numerical Computing – Using NumPy for efficient computation
🧮 Data Handling – Cleaning and transforming data with Pandas
📊 Data Visualization – Exploring data with Matplotlib & Seaborn
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding datasets before modeling
